### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pablo Godoy, a Full Stack developer living in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.

About me:

Full stack developer with more than three years of experience specialized with react, react native, node, and typescript writing testable, scalable, and maintainable code.

Working in Santander, a Bank with more than 3,8 million clients and 9000 employees in Argentina making new experiences for current customers with web and mobile technologies.

One of my main motivations is to continue learning just to know more about what I am passionate about. I first started learning about digital marketing and how to solve work challenges that came across at that time. This is how I began my years as a self-taught person, devouring books and tutorials that I found.
Years later I studied Web design at the Davinci School. And, since then, I have not stopped for a moment to continue working as a developer and continue learning.

I like to bring value from all possible perspectives to the project. Technically I advocate for good practices and performance. From a functional perspective, I apport my experience as a QA and notions of UX to define quality standards. From the business, I bring my experience working in large companies with complex products to understand the business needs and have the analytical skills to refine them into requirements and the technique to carry them out.
I always take care to have an active role in my team and the definition of the business. I like to consider myself one of the project owners and collaborate in the planning and implementation.
I like to understand how things work and broaden my perspectives.
I like to work in a team and while asking for help is not my forte, I enjoy supporting colleagues, always trying to encourage their growth.

I love attending online developer meetings and seeing passionate people inspiring others about what is passionate to me. The best workplace is the one that allows me to be in constant evolution.
